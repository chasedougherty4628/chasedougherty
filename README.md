### Google Maps Project
https://github.com/chasedougherty4628/HelloWorld

This project has several unique aspects to it. Each one has a little code preview below. You can check out the full project with the link above. It's a ruby on rails project design by me. The entire code isn't on the project to protect design.
1. Implementation of Okta for single user sign-on 
2. Javascript implemented with Vue using the Google Maps API for the project
3. Active Record usage to store user search information for data analysis
